                        There are many variations of a company profile. Every company must have their own company profile that provides a professional summary of the business and the many activities that they do. 
                        A company profile has several uses, like informing people and stakeholders about the existence and purpose of the company, to raise capital and to win investors. 
                        The length of oneâ€™s company profile varies depending on the preferences of the company and how they want to have their profiles written.</p>
